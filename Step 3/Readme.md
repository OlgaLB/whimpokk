Test scenarios in Gherkin were selected to be written for the simple use case:  
- user opens Noisli  
- user creates an account  
- user logs in  
- user creates a custom combination per their taste  
- user saves the combination  
- user launches timer  
- user waits until timer ends  
- user logs out  

The 1st automation suite will cover the following from above:  
- user opens Noisli  
- user logs in  
- user creates a custom combination per their taste  
- user launches timer  
This is a happy path scenario which lets the user to use the main functional of Noisli.
